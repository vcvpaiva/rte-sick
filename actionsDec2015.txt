Valeria's suggestions in Dec 2015 (message from Dec 16,2015, 11:33 am)

1. we should be aim to be the UBY of Portuguese, 
except that UBY https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/lexical-resources/uby/
has bits that are non-open source. 

2. Our corpora have been Bosque (Linguateca) and DHBB; 
https://github.com/own-pt/bosque-UD 
and http://wnpt.brlcloud.com/dep_search_webgui/
we should have links with DBpedia-PT (or not?), with Wikidata, Yago (or not?)
Open Thesaurus OmegaWiki-Pt in http://www.omegawiki.org/Meta:Main_Page/pt

3. We should create links to Wikcionario-PT (this is what linked data is about)
We need to work on a subcateogrization lexicon for PT

4. we need a "mutirao" for adjectives.
need a relatorio/report like the ones we have in http://wnpt.brlcloud.com/wn/prototypes for adjectives,
especially the 1000 most used adjectives in PT. 
the problem is that adjectives are not separated into domains, like nouns and verbs.

5. We need to organize the relationship between Nomlex-PT and OpenWordNet-PT.
need to stop having floating ones. the point of linked data is to have several resources 
connected by mappings, but independent from each other. this is not what is happenning with NomLex-PT.

6. We need to decide on a (method to obtain) KBs for named entities
and we need to decide on how we're going to find and recognize named entities.

I am happy to use HeidelTime for temporal expressions, but don't know of a similar project for entities. 
No system is perfect, HeidelTime, Freeling nothign is just right, but we need to use some previous work to get going.
which work is that for NER, mwes and coreference?
