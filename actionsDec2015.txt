Valeria's suggestions in Dec 2015 (message from Dec 16,2015, 11:33 am)

1. we should be aim to be the UBY of Portuguese, 
except that UBY https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/data/lexical-resources/uby/
has bits that are not open source. 

Our corpora are Bosque and DHBB; https://github.com/own-pt/bosque-UD and ???
we should have links with DBpedia-PT or not? with Wikidata, Yago or not?
Open Thesaurus OmegaWiki-Pt in http://www.omegawiki.org/Meta:Main_Page/pt
We need to create links to Wikcionario-PT (this is what linked data is about)
We need to work on a subcateogrization lexicon for PT

2. we need a "mutirao" for adjectives.
need a relatorio/report liek the ones we have in http://wnpt.brlcloud.com/wn/prototypes for adjectives,
especially the 1000 most used adjectives in PT. 
the problem is that adjectives are not separated into domains, like nouns and verbs.

3. We need to organize the relationship between Nomlex-PT and OepnWordNet-PT.
need to stop having floating ones. the point of linked data is to have several resources 
connected by mappings, but independent from each other. this is not what is happenning with NomLex-PT.

4. We need to decide on a KB for named entities and we need to decide on how we're going to find and recognize named entities.
I am happy to use HeidelTime for temporal expressions, but don't know of a similar project for entities. 
No system is perfect, HeidelTime, Freeling nothign is just right, but we need to use some work to get going.
which work is that?
