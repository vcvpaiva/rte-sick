Cleaning up my inbox I realized that we never went back to my idea of
using the sketch of domain ontology in

http://sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sigmakee/KBs/development/Biography.kif?view=log

to help structure the DHBB. I think Adam Pease and Michal did quite a bit
more work on professions, need to check iwth them.

What's the state of play there?

the proceedings of the workshop that I wanted to send something then
are now online at http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1399/
and there's at least one paper that is interesting.

so my suggestion in Oct 2014, if you don't remember (and I didn't
either) was:

We download the wikipedia in Portuguese, and use the titles of DHBB
entries (7,500 ) as search queries to wikipedia .
collect all the items that appear with those single titles and take the
first paragraph as summary (wikipedia's writing should work for this heuristic function,
except that sometimes it does not work ... ) . as a second step we pass
this new corpus by Freeling and do the same job we did for the
DHandES paper of looking at things that appear more frequently and use
the entities that
show up to make another search on wikipedia .

in this second step there should appear wikipedia entries for Minas
Gerais, Ipiranga, "Palacio do Catete " etc that do not have (I presume) their own
entries in DHBB . this way we build a Portuguese history automatic
thesaurus that only needs to be hand checked by real people. 
----------

More recently I have given up on the idea of using the DHBB data, but I am still interested in
producing a glossary for Brazilian History automatically from MENTA or Wikipedia.
